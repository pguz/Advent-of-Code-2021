# Advent of Code 2021

My solutions to the this year's [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) written in Python.

The code was written using `Python 3.8.10`, however it should be compatible with the default `python3` command.

To run the solution for a given day for a given task run simply 
```sh
python3 run_solution.py --day 07 --task 02
```

You may want to check the calculated result with the expected one. In that case run simply:
```sh
python3 run_solution.py --day 07 --task 02 --expected-result 100
```

As I have not started/finished all tasks yet or just simply I have not prepared a solution in a repository-specific format, I will still add some solutions.
